This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in PHP: implicit null returns from ternary operators.  The `bug.php` file contains code that uses a ternary operator without explicitly handling the `false` condition, leading to an implicit `null` return.  The `bugSolution.php` file shows how to correct this issue by explicitly handling both `true` and `false` conditions, preventing unexpected null values.
